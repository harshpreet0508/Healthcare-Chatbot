# ü§ñ HEALTHCARE CHATBOT ü§ñ

### Description

Chatbot as the name suggests is a program that can interact with a user via text or voice interface. It is a text-based chatbot with which one can communicate and get a reply through artificial intelligence. Chatbots are programmed in such a way that they respond the same way each time, to respond differently to messages containing different keywords and using ML to adapt to fit the situation. These days hospitals use these chatbots to communicate with different people visiting their websites, helping them discover specialists and further book their appointments. These systems can help to provide support 24 x 7 without human involvement. By asking different types of questions, it guides patients to get everything he/she is looking for.

### Features

* Language used : Python
* Libraries used: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, tkinter 
* Algorithm Used: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and K Nearest Neighbour

### Implementation

* Step 1: Enter the name of patient. It is compulsory for predictions.
* Step 2: Enter atleast 2 symptoms from the drop down list.
* Step 3: Click on Prediction for the results from different algorithms.
* Step 4: Based on the symptoms, the model predicts the disease.

## Conclusion

Chatbots can never replace the work of the doctors yet they can help reduce their workload and help providing some facilities like performing self diagnostic check with help of AI and ML algorithms. By using 4 of these algorithms we acheived an average of 94%. This system can be somewhat reliable and could reduce the rush to OPD's thereby reducing workload on hospital staff. Futhermore, it can help scheduling appointments, answer general queries related to hospital or doctors, sending reminders, basically for user's engagement 24*7.

The chatbots replacing humans for certain functions definitely makes the process more effective while saving money for both in the short and long terms. A win-win situation which can only get better as the bots become more and more ‚Äúlearned‚Äù in their tasks.
